# Stack Overflow Survey Dashboard

This dashboard was created with the Dash Python framework. 

While this project is not officially part of the [IBM Data Analyst Capstone - Python](https://github.com/FaiLuReH3Ro/ibm-da-capstone-py) project, the dataset used in this dashboard comes directly from the [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/FaiLuReH3Ro/data-wrangling-py) section.

## Objectives

The goal with this dashboard is to help answer the same questions as in the `IBM Data Analyst Capstone - Python` project.

* Which programming languages are most in demand?
* Which database technologies are currently most sought after?
* Which Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are the most popular?

## Dataset Used

Stack Overflow’s global survey captures insights on developers’ experience, tools, technologies, and preferences, offering a snapshot of the software development landscape.
