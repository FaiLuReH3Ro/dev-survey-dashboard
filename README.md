# Stack Overflow Survey Dashboard ðŸ’»

This dashboard was created with the Dash Python framework. 

While this project is not officially part of the [IBM Data Analyst Capstone - Python](https://github.com/FaiLuReH3Ro/ibm-da-capstone-py) project, the dataset used in this dashboard comes directly from the [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/FaiLuReH3Ro/data-wrangling-py) section.

## ðŸš€ Objectives

The goal with this dashboard is to help answer the same questions as in the `IBM Data Analyst Capstone - Python` project.

Technology skills evolve quickly, making it difficult for companies to align talent with demand. IT consulting firms must stay competitive by understanding emerging tech skills. I aim to help organizations focus hiring, training, and investments in the right areas by providing data-driven insights and predictive analysis into which programming languages, databases, and tools are most in demand.

* Which programming languages are most in demand?
* Which database technologies are currently most sought after?
* Which Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are the most popular?

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used

The primary dataset used is the 2024 Stack Overflow global survey. Stack Overflow is a Q&A website for programmers where developers ask coding questions and get answers from the community. The survey aims to capture insights on developersâ€™ experience, tools, technologies, and preferences, offering a snapshot of the software development landscape.
